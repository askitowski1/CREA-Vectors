Our goal is to collect judgments on many aspects of meaning for a large number of English words. Please do not complete this HIT unless you are a native English speaker.<\/p><p><br><\/p>\n\n<p>This activity is a research study. Your participation is completely voluntary. To protect your privacy, we will not request from you or from Amazon Mechanical Turk any information that can be used to identify you, thus the responses you provide will be completely confidential.<\/p><p><br><\/p>\n\n<p>In each session you will be assigned a word, for example,&nbsp;<i>shoe<\/i>, and a sentence that illustrates how the word is used, such as \"The boy put on his&nbsp;<i>shoe<\/i>.\" You will then be asked a series of questions about the meaning of the word. We estimate that it will take approximately 15 minutes to answer these questions for each word. PLEASE TAKE YOUR TIME. The information you provide will only be scientifically useful if you put some thought into it!<\/p><p><br><\/p>\n\n<p>For example, you might be asked, \"To what degree do you think of&nbsp;<i>shoe<\/i>&nbsp;as being heavy in weight?\" For each such judgment, you will use a rating scale ranging from 0 to 6, with 0 meaning \"not at all\" and 6 meaning \"very much\". Because such scales are relative, you will also be given an example of a concept that would typically receive a high rating on the question, and an example that would typically receive a rating near the middle of the scale. For the question about heaviness, the high-rated example is&nbsp;<i>anvil<\/i>&nbsp;and the medium example is&nbsp;<i>bookcase<\/i>. Given these definitions of heavy, you might rate shoe at about 1 on the scale.<\/p><p><br><\/p>\n\n<p>Other judgments will be about more abstract aspects of meaning, such as, \"To what degree do you think of&nbsp;<i>shoe<\/i>&nbsp;as someone or something that could help or benefit you or others?\", with the example of a high-rated concept being&nbsp;<i>cure<\/i>, and the medium example being&nbsp;<i>news<\/i>. In this case you might give shoe a rating of 3 or 4, depending on how beneficial you think shoes are to people.<\/p><p><br><\/p>\n\n<p>Other questions will be almost nonsensical, because they refer to aspects of word meaning that are not even applicable to your word. For example, you might be asked, \"To what degree do you think of&nbsp;<i>shoe<\/i>&nbsp;as an event that has a predictable duration, whether short or long?\", with&nbsp;<i>movie<\/i>&nbsp;given as an example of a high-rated concept, and&nbsp;<i>concert<\/i>&nbsp;given as a medium-rated concept. Since&nbsp;<i>shoe<\/i>&nbsp;refers to a static thing, not to an event of any kind, you should indicate either 0 or \"Not Applicable\" for this question.<\/p><p><br><\/p>\n\n<p>Please give your best estimate for each rating. Ideally the collection of ratings you give for your word should allow another person to guess what the word is, something like the \"20 questions\" game.<\/p><p><br><\/p>\n\n<p>Thanks again for participating in The Word Meaning Survey!<\/p><p><br><\/p>\n\n<p>If you have any questions or concerns about this study, you may contact:<\/p>\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Dr. Jeffrey Binder<br>\nMedical College of Wisconsin<br>\n8701 Watertown Plank Road<br>\nMilwaukee, WI 53226 USA<\/div>","DefaultChoices":false,"DataExportTag":"Q1","QuestionID":"QID1","QuestionType":"DB","Selector":"TB","DataVisibility":{"Private":false,"Hidden":false},"Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText"},"QuestionDescription":"The Word Meaning Survey Thank you for participating in The Word Meaning Survey, an effort to disc...","ChoiceOrder":[],"Validation":{"Settings":{"Type":"None"}},"GradingData":[],"Language":[],"NextChoiceId":4,"NextAnswerId":1}},{"SurveyID":"SV_5dt5OUxI4gjbNb0","Element":"SQ","PrimaryAttribute":"QID12","SecondaryAttribute":"Timing","TertiaryAttribute":null,"Payload":{"QuestionText":"Timing","DefaultChoices":false,"DataExportTag":"Timer","QuestionType":"Timing","Selector":"PageTimer","Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText","MinSeconds":2,"MaxSeconds":"0"},"QuestionDescription":"Timing","Choices":{"1":{"Display":"First Click"},"2":{"Display":"Last Click"},"3":{"Display":"Page Submit"},"4":{"Display":"Click Count"}},"GradingData":[],"Language":[],"NextChoiceId":64,"NextAnswerId":1,"QuestionID":"QID12"}},{"SurveyID":"SV_5dt5OUxI4gjbNb0","Element":"SQ","PrimaryAttribute":"QID4","SecondaryAttribute":"What is your current age?","TertiaryAttribute":null,"Payload":{"QuestionText":"What is your current age?","DefaultChoices":false,"DataExportTag":"Age","QuestionType":"TE","Selector":"SL","Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText"},"QuestionDescription":"What is your current age?","Validation":{"Settings":{"ForceResponse":"ON","ForceResponseType":"ON","Type":"ContentType","MinChars":"1","ContentType":"ValidNumber","ValidDateType":"DateWithFormat","ValidPhoneType":"ValidUSPhone","ValidZipType":"ValidUSZip","ValidNumber":{"Min":"","Max":"","NumDecimals":""}}},"GradingData":[],"Language":[],"NextChoiceId":4,"NextAnswerId":1,"SearchSource":{"AllowFreeResponse":"false"},"QuestionID":"QID4"}},{"SurveyID":"SV_5dt5OUxI4gjbNb0","Element":"SQ","PrimaryAttribute":"QID5","SecondaryAttribute":"What is your gender?","TertiaryAttribute":null,"Payload":{"QuestionText":"What is your gender?","DataExportTag":"Sex","QuestionType":"MC","Selector":"SAVR","SubSelector":"TX","Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText"},"QuestionDescription":"What is your gender?","Choices":{"1":{"Display":"Male"},"2":{"Display":"Female"},"5":{"Display":"Other"}},"ChoiceOrder":["1","2","5"],"Validation":{"Settings":{"ForceResponse":"ON","ForceResponseType":"ON","Type":"None"}},"Language":[],"NextChoiceId":6,"NextAnswerId":1,"QuestionID":"QID5","DataVisibility":{"Private":false,"Hidden":false}}}]}
